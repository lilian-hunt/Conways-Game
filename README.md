The Game of Life universe is set in a 2 dimensional grid.  The cells in the life field can be in one of two states: dead or alive.  Each generation, the cells interact with its 8 neighbours giving rise to these 4 rules:

1. A living cell with less than 2 live neighbours die (of starvation)

2. A living cell with 2-3 live neighbours live

3. A living cell with more than 3 neighbours die (of the plague)

4. A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours become alive (by divine intervention)

This program generates the next generation of the field.
